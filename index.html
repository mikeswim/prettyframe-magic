                            <p>I discovered the Institute Of Aquaphobia training a couple of years ago and it has changed my entire approach to teaching as well as opened my eyes to a whole community of people who were hidden or hiding in plain sight.

                            <p>Born and raised in New Zealand, I come from a family long involved in swimming and water safety. I specialised in adult learn-to-swim and adaptive swimming for physical disabilities.</p>
